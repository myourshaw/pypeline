## C_blosum	: a measure of the conservation of the reference amino acid with the aligned amino acids in orthologous sequences. The alignment score for the reference amino acid vs. the orthologous amino acids is divided by the alignment score that would be obtained if all the orthologous residues matched the reference. Higher values tend to be associated with changes to the amino acid having a greater functional consequence. The formula used is equivalent to the C_blosum formula given in Kowarsch A et al. (2010 PLoS Comput Biol 6(9): e1000923), except that in NGS-SNP scoring matrices other than BLOSUM62 can be used (NGS-SNP)
## Context_Conservation	: the average percent identity obtained when the region of the reference protein containing the SNP-affected residue is aligned with the orthologous region from other species. The size of the region examined is determined by the -cf option, which specifies how much sequence on either side of the SNP to examine. For example, if '-cf 10' is used, the size of the region is 10 + 1 + 10 = 21 (NGS-SNP)
## Amino_Acids_In_Orthologues	: the amino acids aligned with the reference amino acid in orthologous sequences (NGS-SNP)
## KEGG_Pathway	: KEGG pathway(s) (| separated) for gene (KEGG)
## HGMD_insertion	: Insertions are presented in terms of the inserted bases in lower case plus, in upper case, 10 bp DNA sequence flanking both sides of the lesion. The numbered codon from the AMINO field is preceded in the given sequence by the caret character (^). (HGMD)

## HGMD_tag	: This field categorizes mutations and polymorphisms. There are four possible values, DM, DP, DFP, and FP. DM are disease-causing mutations, pathological mutations reported to be disease causing in the original literature report. The other three tags are used for polymorphisms. DP are disease-associated polymorphisms. These are reported to be in significant association with disease (p<0.05) and are assumed to be functional (e.g. as a consequence of location, evolutionary conservation, replication studies etc), although there may be as yet no direct evidence (e.g. from an expression study) of function. DFP are disease-associated polymorphisms with additional supporting functional evidence. These are reported to be in significant association with disease (p<0.05) and to have evidence for being of direct functional importance (e.g. as a consequence of altered expression, mRNA studies etc). FP are in vitro/laboratory or in vivo functional polymorphisms. These are reported to affect the structure, function or expression of the gene (or gene product), but with no disease association reported as yet. (HGMD)
## HGMD_deletion	: Deletions are presented in terms of the deleted bases in lower case plus, in upper case, 10 bp DNA sequence flanking both sides of the lesion. Intron/exon boundary information may be provided where identified (e.g. _I12E13_). The codon number in the CODON field represents the last whole codon preceding the deletion, and is marked in the given sequence by the caret character (^). (HGMD)
## HGMD_amino	: This field is specific to single base pair substitutions and contains the description of the nucleotide change. This is presented in terms of a triplet change with an additional flanking base included if the mutated base lies in either the first or third position in the triplet. For example, TACg-TAT represents a change of the last nucleotide C in the triplet to a T. TGT-TAT represents a change of the middle nucleotide G to an A. Note that the triplet itself is in upper-case letters, while the additional flanking base is in lower-case. (HGMD)
